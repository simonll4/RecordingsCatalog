# Code comments and documentation summary

This document lists the files that were documented in-source and summarizes the notable comments or JSDoc added. It also contains a small set of recommended cleanup items discovered during a quick audit.

Files documented (high level)

- `src/main.ts` — App bootstrap; registers Pinia and Router; mount App.
- `src/App.vue` — App layout with header and `RouterView`.
- `src/router/index.ts` — Route definitions for `/` and `/session/:sessionId`.
- `src/config.ts` — Configuration helpers and constants (`SESSION_STORE_BASE_URL`, `MEDIAMTX_BASE_URL`, `mediamtxGetUrl`).
- `src/api/sessions.ts` — HTTP client to the session store. Added `HttpError`, `fetchJson` helper JSDoc, and comments for `listSessions`, `fetchSessionMeta`, `fetchSessionIndex`, `fetchSessionClip`, `fetchSessionSegment`.
- `src/types/tracks.ts` — Added JSDoc to `TrackObject`, `TrackEvent`, `TrackMeta`, `TrackIndex`, `FetchedSegment`, `RenderObject`, `RenderFrame`.
- `src/workers/ndjsonParser.worker.ts` — Documented NDJSON parsing logic and gzip handling.
- `src/stores/segmentCache.ts` — Dexie schema and usage; get/put/clearSession documented.
- `src/stores/useSessions.ts`, `src/stores/usePlayer.ts`, `src/stores/useTracks.ts` — Extensive JSDoc and inline comments describing store state, methods, LRU, caching, ensureSegment, prefetch, and event filters.
- `src/components/*` (`SessionSearch.vue`, `SessionList.vue`, `Player.vue`, `CanvasOverlay.vue`, `TrackLegend.vue`, icons) — Documented props, emits, lifecycle behavior and rendering logic.
- `src/views/Home.vue`, `src/views/Session.vue` — Documented session load flow, initialization, and overlay activation.

Quick audit findings

- Exports are actively used by components and stores. No obvious unused exported symbols were found in the initial search (common exports: stores, api functions, types, `segmentCache`).
- `segmentCache` is referenced in `src/stores/useTracks.ts` and defined in `src/stores/segmentCache.ts`.
- Several `console.*` usages remain; they appear intentional for debug/fallback flows.

Recommended follow-ups (low-risk)

- Run a full TypeScript and ESLint pass locally (or CI) to catch any stylistic issues introduced while adding comments. I ran `npm run type-check` after edits and it succeeded.
- If you want unused exports removed, I can run a deeper symbol-usage analysis and create a PR that either removes them or marks them with `// TODO: remove if unused` comments.
- Consider turning debug `console.debug` statements behind a small logging facade that can be toggled in production builds.

What I changed

- Added JSDoc and inline comments in the listed files. These were documentation-only changes and should not alter runtime behavior.

Next steps

- I can (A) finish a deeper dead-code cleanup and open a PR with removals or TODOs; or (B) stop here and only provide the final report. Tell me which you prefer.

Audit performed: exported symbols and references search across `src/`.
Type-check: `npm run type-check` passed after the edits.
